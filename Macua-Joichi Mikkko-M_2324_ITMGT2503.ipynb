Each Fighter costs 1000 gold coins, each Ranger costs 600 gold coins, and each Cleric costs 750 gold coins. Lumber: The construction of necessary equipment for each troop requires ample quality lumber. The kingdom has 12000 units of lumber available for the raid. Each Fighter requires 500 units, each Ranger requires 750 units, and each Cleric requires 300 units. Food: The raid will last several weeks so food must be kept and stored during the raid. The raid will be able to carry 1500 units of food available for the raid. Each Fighter requires 50 units, each Ranger requires 45 units, and each Cleric requires 75 units.
